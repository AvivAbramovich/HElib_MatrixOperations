This files are some tests to my addition classes.
To run them, you need

1. Make sure you installed HElib, using my modified makefile and files (As described in “INSTALL.txt”
2. Transfer the file to the directory where HElib installed (the one include the makefile)
3. In the terminal, navigate to that directory
4. Compile the test file using the command:
	make FILE_NAME_x
for example, for the file “Matrices_Multiplication.cpp” the command would be “make Matrices_Multiplication_x” (no .cpp extension)
